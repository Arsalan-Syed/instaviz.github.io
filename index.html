Hello World

We want to use instagram data to visualise community interactions as a network. Our data contains instagram posts with geolocations and likes. To represent this network, we will let nodes be individual instagram users as well as communities and the edges will be likes between usersâ€™ posts. The visualisation will start off with an overall view of several communities and when one of these is clicked on, it will zoom in and show the internal structure of this community. So for example, a community of people in Lausanne could contain the subcommunity Students which further contains EPFL and UNIL students and eventually we reach the bottom where it will contain individual students. The target audience for this visualisation is aimed at the general public in Lausanne but could also be useful to people who run a business or in charge of tourism so that they can see who the main groups of people attending their attractions are.
